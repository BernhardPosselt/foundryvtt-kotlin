# OGL questions

Kingmaker

* Allowed to use random encounter roll tables?
* Allowed to use random kingdom events or are these considered storylines?
* Proper module name: is Kingmaker Tools (Unofficial) ok or do I need to rename it as "Kingdom Building, Camping &
  Weather" - "No!!!"
* Am I allowed to reference ip purely in code? e.g. name a piece of code kingmakerSomething()

# TODO

* Update manual
* Add upgrading notice
* Always display manual in chat unless specifically disabled
* Remove page numbers from random encounter tables
* Remove any mentions of Kingmaker compatibility
* Migrate structure image conversion macro
* Rename module to "Kingdom Building, Camping & Weather"
* Test camping & rolling random encounters

## Non OGLisms

Clean the followings things off OGLism:

* Companion Leadership & Region Activities
* Companion Names

## Camping

* Don't consider locked activities for effect syncing unless companion checkboxes are clicked
* Roll activity check
* Sync camping effects
* Prepare Camp
* Implement camping sheet navigation
* Update docs
* Add/Edit Activities
* Add checkboxes to auto enable camping activities without checks for companions
* Design for eating
* Resting (playlist + check + removing fx + healing + macro)
* Put combat efects to chat after rolling perception check
* Apply meal effects should ask if it should consume rations and ingredients instead of clicking on separate buttons
